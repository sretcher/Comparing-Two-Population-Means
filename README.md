### Comparing Two Population Means: Independent Sampling.
In the Academy of Management Journal, a study set out to investigate if rude behavior negatively affects work performance. Students in a management course were randomly seperated into two experimental conditions : rudeness (n=45) and control (n=53). Students were asked to write down as many uses for a brick as possible in five mintutes; this value would be a performance measure for each student.

Students in the rudeness conditions were berated by the facilitator about being irresponsible and unproffesional because of a late-arriving confederate. In the control group, no comment was made about the late-arriving confederate. We will use a two sample z-test to see if the true mean performace level of the rudeness group is less than the true mean performance level for the control group.
